```

### Testing Frameworks Used
- **Backend:** Jest + Supertest for API testing
- **Frontend:** Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **E2E:** Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Mocking:** Comprehensive service and database mocking

### Coverage Areas
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual component and service functionality
2. **Integration Tests:** Cross-service communication and workflows
3. **End-to-End Tests:** Complete user journeys across the application
4. **Error Scenarios:** Failure modes and recovery mechanisms
5. **Performance Tests:** Load handling and optimization verification

## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Compliance Testing
```javascript
// Ensures queries use correct timestamp column
expect(supabase.from).toHaveBeenCalledWith('email_activities');
const calls = supabase.from().gte.mock.calls;
const timestampCall = calls.find(call => call[0] === 'timestamp');
expect(timestampCall).toBeDefined();
```

### 2. Navigation Context Preservation Testing
```javascript
// Verifies OAuth2 state includes navigation context
await page.waitForRequest(request => 
  request.url().includes('/api/oauth2/') && 
  request.postDataJSON()?.navigationContext?.preserveWorkflow === true
);
```

### 3. Error Recovery Path Testing
```javascript
// Tests graceful degradation during failures
supabase.from().select().eq().single.mockRejectedValue(timeoutError);
connectionManager.query.mockResolvedValue(fallbackData);
// Verify fallback mechanism works
```

### 4. Workflow Integration Testing
```javascript
// Tests complete user journeys
await loginUser(page);
await page.goto(`${BASE_URL}/campaigns`);
await startCampaignCreation(page);
await triggerAccountAddition(page);
await completeOAuth2Flow(page);
await verifyCampaignWorkflowContinues(page);
```

## Regression Prevention

### Critical Areas Protected
1. **Database Schema Changes:** Tests prevent reintroduction of incorrect column references
2. **OAuth2 Flow Breaks:** Comprehensive flow testing catches authorization issues
3. **Navigation Context Loss:** Tests ensure users stay in their intended workflows
4. **Authentication Redirects:** Prevents unwanted dashboard redirects during workflows
5. **Error Handling Regressions:** Ensures graceful failure handling continues to work

### Continuous Integration Ready
