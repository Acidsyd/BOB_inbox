## Files That Remain Unchanged
The following files contain the problematic language but are documentation/development files that don't affect the production Stripe integration:
- Various documentation files in `/docs/`
- Git commit history
- Archive folders
- Test files
- Development logs

These files don't impact the Stripe business profile or payment processing, so they were left unchanged to maintain development history and context.

2. Ensure all product descriptions in Stripe dashboard match the updated configuration
3. Update any external marketing materials to use the new compliant language
