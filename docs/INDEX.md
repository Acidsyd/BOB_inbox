## Note on File Organization

As of the latest reorganization (August 2025), all documentation has been moved from the project root to this `/docs` directory for better organization. If you find references to documentation files without the `docs/` prefix, they should be updated to point to the new locations.

Configuration files have been moved to `/config/`, scripts to `/scripts/`, and the main project directories (`backend/`, `frontend/`) remain in the root for easy access.
