Phase 4 Testing Workstream: Create comprehensive Playwright test suite

SYSTEM STATE:
- Backend: Healthy at port 4000 (24MB heap, excellent performance)
- Frontend: Active at port 3001 (Next.js 15)
- 9 essential routes operational: auth, campaigns, leads, email-accounts, scheduling, logs, support, leadImports, leadManagement
- Supabase database with 1000 leads and 9 email accounts
- Existing test structure: backend/tests with unit, integration, e2e, playwright directories
- Frontend tests: limited coverage in __tests__/ directory

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate comprehensive Playwright test suites for ALL pages and workflows:
   - Authentication: login, register, logout flows
   - Dashboard: data display and navigation
   - Leads: import, table operations, filtering, CRUD operations
   - Campaigns: creation wizard, email sequence, template management
   - Email Accounts: setup, OAuth2 flow, health monitoring
   - Settings: billing, account management

2. E2E workflow testing covering complete user journeys:
   - Registration → Email account setup → Lead import → Campaign creation → Email sending
   - Lead management: CSV upload, data enrichment, list creation
   - Campaign execution: template selection, scheduling, progress monitoring

3. Cross-browser validation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile responsiveness
4. Performance testing and API endpoint validation
5. Database state validation after operations
6. Error scenario testing (network failures, invalid inputs, edge cases)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 100% page coverage (all 9 routes + frontend pages)
- 95% workflow coverage (complete user journeys)
- 90% edge case coverage (error scenarios)
- Test reliability: <2% flaky rate
- Execution time: <5 minutes full suite
- Integration with MCP tools for database operations

FILES TO WORK WITH:
- backend/tests/playwright/ (existing Playwright tests)
- backend/playwright.config.js (configuration)
- frontend/__tests__/ (existing Jest tests)
- Use MCP postgres for test data validation
- Use MCP git for CI/CD integration

Please generate comprehensive test suites that ensure system reliability and provide detailed coverage reporting.
